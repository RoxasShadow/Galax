The original idea
=================

Never watched “Gatchaman Crowds?” All the characters in this anime have a smartphone with an app called Galax: it allows the user to keep in touch with everyone in the city where they live, just like Massive Multiplayer Online games.
So, I tought to make an app based on this idea.

What's Galax?
=============

Well, it's an app for Android devices that interfaces itself with a server written in Sinatra.
The app requires a constant internet connection (3G is enough) and the GPS, in order to know where you are.

After you are log in the service, you will can:

* Make a public profile with your name or nickname, a status and your hobbies or a small self-description.
* Read the profile of all people who live in your area.
* Chat with a person in particular or simply in the general chat, common at all the people around you.

Let me tell you a fact: This summer I visited Paestum. It's usually full of tourists, and I was looking for a comic shop or a bookstore who sells Manga and surely I couldn't ask an old man about them. If Galax would have existed, I'd asked in the main chat to know more about the local comic shop (and no, unfortunately I hadn't found it...).
